# Azure Arc Benefits Dashboard

Track and maximize your Azure Arc-enabled server and SQL Server Arc benefits with comprehensive visibility into configured services and potential cost savings.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Azure Workbook (Recommended)

The **Azure Workbook** is the easiest and most powerful way to deploy this dashboard. It provides a native Azure Portal experience with real-time data and requires no hosting or authentication setup.

### Why Choose the Workbook?

✅ **Zero Infrastructure** - No hosting, no servers, no web apps  
✅ **Native Portal Experience** - Integrated directly into Azure Monitor  
✅ **Real-Time Data** - Live queries against Azure Resource Graph  
✅ **Built-in Security** - Uses Azure Portal authentication  
✅ **Rich Features** - Windows Arc + SQL Server Arc tracking, cost analysis toggle, collapsible notes  
✅ **Easy Deployment** - Import JSON file in 2 minutes  

**📋 Get started with the workbook:** [workbook/README.md](workbook/README.md)

## 📊 Alternative: Static Web App

If you prefer a standalone web application with custom branding and offline capabilities, you can deploy the static web app version.

### When to Use the Web App:
- Need custom branding or styling
- Want offline/localhost development
- Prefer traditional web hosting over Azure Portal
- Need localStorage persistence for user settings

**📋 See web app deployment guide:** [webapp/README.md](webapp/README.md)

## 🎯 Purpose

Many organizations with Azure Arc don't fully utilize all the capabilities they're paying for. This dashboard helps:

- **Visualize** all available Arc benefits in one place (Windows + SQL Server)
- **Identify** unconfigured capabilities that could save money or improve operations
- **Track** which services are actively configured across your environment
- **Calculate** potential labor cost savings from unused capabilities
- **Monitor** compliance and best practices adoption

## ✨ Key Features

### Workbook Features (v2.0)
- **Windows Arc Capabilities** - 10 services (Update Manager, Defender, Monitoring, etc.)
- **SQL Server Arc Capabilities** - 3 services (BPA, Performance, Inventory)
- **Cost Analysis Toggle** - Show/hide cost calculations and PotentialSavings column
- **Radio Button Navigation** - Clean switching between Windows and SQL views
- **Collapsible Notes** - Detailed benefit descriptions collapsed by default
- **Real-time Queries** - Live data from Azure Resource Graph
- **Export to Excel** - Built-in export functionality

### Web App Features
- **Interactive Dashboard** - Visual cards with status indicators
- **Filtering** - By category, status, and benefit type
- **Custom Branding** - Full control over styling and layout
- **localStorage** - Persistent user settings
- **Offline Support** - Works without internet connection
